# Nucleotide_Sequence_Analyzer
The Nucleotide Sequence Analyzer is a Python-based GUI framework designed to analyze nucleotide sequences. This tool offers a range of operations to analyze DNA and RNA sequences, providing valuable insights into their composition and structure.

Key Features:

Sequence Length: Quickly determine the length of the input nucleotide sequence.
Nucleotide Frequency: Analyze the frequency of each nucleotide (A, T, G, C) in the sequence.
Convert to RNA: Convert the input DNA sequence into its RNA equivalent.
GC Content: Calculate the GC content of the DNA sequence.
Open Reading Frames (ORFs): Identify potential ORFs in the sequence.
Proteins: Generate possible protein sequences based on the input DNA sequence and its reading frames.
Triplet Analysis: Perform an analysis of nucleotide triplets in the sequence.

How to Use:

Enter a nucleotide sequence in the provided text box.
Select the operation you wish to perform from the dropdown menu.
Click the "Run" button to view the results.

Why Use Nucleotide Sequence Analyzer?

User-Friendly Interface: The GUI makes it easy to input sequences and interpret the results.
Comprehensive Analysis: The tool provides a wide range of analytical operations, covering various aspects of nucleotide sequences.
Educational and Research Purposes: Suitable for students, researchers, and professionals working in bioinformatics and molecular biology fields.

Future Enhancements:

Integration with online databases to retrieve additional information about identified proteins.
Advanced visualization features for a better understanding of sequence analysis results.
